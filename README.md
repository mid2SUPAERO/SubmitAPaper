https://sharelex.org/t/que-signifie-preprint-postprint-reprint/171

start an overleaf project 

CC-BY license throughout the publication process
(https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/, from the first submission (preprint) to the various
revisions. This alternative, when accepted by the publishers, allows the authors' postprint version to be shared without embargo with a license affixed (it does not concern the publisher version which
remains the owner of this version). It is important, when depositing on HAL, to add the license on
HAL when depositing the manuscript.

When the review process is on. It means you have uploaded your pdf on the editor website and you are waiting for the external reviewers. you got your preprint here.
You can put on ArXiv at this step even with YOUR code

3 options Rejected, Major corrections, Minor Corrections.

Major often needs more computation...

Wait for their feedback, correct the manuscript according to the reviewers, provide a letter called "response to reviewers"
see response.tex


English check after the first round if needed (Ask JM), depending on the journal UK or US style !

The after R1 (Revision1) if  Accepted as is,

that you can be upload the preprint on [openscience.isae.fr](https://openscience.isae-supaero.fr)
