How to deal with Preprint, OATAO, HAL etc...


When the review process is on. It means you have uploaded your pdf on the editor website and you are waiting for the external reviewers.

3 options Rejected, Major corrections, Minor Corrections.

Major often needs more computation...

Wait for their feedback, correct the manuscript according to the reviewers, provide a letter called "response to reviewers"
see response.tex


English check after the first round if needed (Ask JM), depending on the journal UK or US style !

The after R1 (Revision1) if  Accepeted as is, you got your preprint

that can be uploaded on OATAO (then pushed to HAL, please ask it)
https://oatao.univ-toulouse.fr
https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr

BTW my orcid

You can also put on ArXiv at this step. Then it will be automatically read by Institue Clement Ader Website

Then, you shoud wait for the proofs, correct them (style, form ONLY)
