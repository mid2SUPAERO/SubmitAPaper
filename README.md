How to deal with Preprint, OATAO, HAL, ArXiv etc...


When the review process is on. It means you have uploaded your pdf on the editor website and you are waiting for the external reviewers. you got your preprint here.
You can put on ArXiv at this step.

3 options Rejected, Major corrections, Minor Corrections.

Major often needs more computation...

Wait for their feedback, correct the manuscript according to the reviewers, provide a letter called "response to reviewers"
see response.tex


English check after the first round if needed (Ask JM), depending on the journal UK or US style !

The after R1 (Revision1) if  Accepted as is,

that you can be upload the preprint on OATAO (then pushed to HAL, please ask it)
https://oatao.univ-toulouse.fr
https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr
